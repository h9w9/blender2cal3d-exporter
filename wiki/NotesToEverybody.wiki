= Blender2Cal3dExporter =

This project aim to provide Blender 2.6x an exporter in order to export animated model into Cal3d format

Not really work well for Miku model's fingers but it's automatic...


== TODO ==

  * Update meshes's weights of removed bones to the nearest bones...(I think it can do the tricks)
  * Use IPO instead of the current heavy baked animation
  * A lot of cleaning 

== How to use ==
  # File->user Preferences
  # Add ons
  # Install Add ons
  # Search the mycalexporter.py file and install
  # File->export->Cal3D(.cfg)
  # A temporary skeleton is generated so go in edit mode and remove FK, IK and other animator bones
  #return to Object Mode and left click on the original model to continue the export.

== Where to find Cal3d library ==
Cal3d is mandatory if you want to test results. It can be found here:
