= Blender2Cal3dExporter =

This project aim to provide Blender 2.6x an exporter in order to export animated model into Cal3d format

Not really work well for Miku model's fingers but it's automatic...



== How to use ==
  # Go in object mode (check to Matrix World Transform has no scale or rotation)
  # Select BOTH meshes and armatures to export (savin at this point can be a good idea)
  # File->export->Cal3D(.cfg)
  # A temporary skeleton is generated so go remove bones you don't want
  # return to Object Mode and right click on the original model to continue the export.

== Where to find Cal3d library ==
Cal3d is mandatory if you want to test results. It can be found here:
